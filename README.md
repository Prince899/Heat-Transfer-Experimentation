# Heat Transfer Experimentation – Natural & Forced Convection

This repository contains an **experimental study on natural and forced convection heat transfer** using a vertical hollow copper rod with internal heating and external airflow. The project demonstrates practical application of heat transfer correlations and compares theoretical vs experimental results.

## Experiment Setup
- **Copper Rod**: Length = 200 mm, Outer Diameter = 39.86 mm, Inner Diameter = 34.26 mm  
- **Heating Input**: 42 V, 0.24 A applied to an internal heater  
- **Temperature Sensors**:  
  - T1 → Ambient temperature  
  - T2, T3, T4 → Temperatures along the rod surface  
- **Cases Studied**:  
  - Natural Convection (heating + cooling)  
  - Forced Convection (cooling with external airflow)

##  Methodology
- Recorded transient **temperature profiles** during heating and cooling.  
- Applied standard **heat transfer correlations** for natural and forced convection.  
- Performed **data processing, curve fitting, and coefficient estimation**.  
- Compared experimental results with theoretical predictions.

## Results
- Determined **heat transfer coefficients** for both convection modes.  
- Verified that **forced convection enhanced cooling rates** compared to natural convection.  
- Observed good agreement with standard convection correlations.
